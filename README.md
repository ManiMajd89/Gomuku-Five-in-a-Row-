# Gomoku AI Game

This project is a Python implementation of the Gomoku board game, complete with an AI opponent and interactive gameplay. The AI is built using heuristic-based scoring, enabling it to make strategic moves while competing against a human player.

## Features
	•	AI Opponent: Evaluates board states, detects sequences (open, semi-open, and closed), and selects optimal moves using a scoring function.
	•	Interactive Gameplay: Play against the AI on an 8x8 board with real-time feedback on moves and board analysis.
	•	Sequence Detection: Identifies and analyzes rows of stones to determine their type (open, semi-open, or closed) for both players.
	•	Game Analysis: Provides detailed insights into the current state of the board, including open and semi-open sequences for both black and white stones.
	•	Win Detection: Determines the game outcome (win, draw, or continue) based on Gomoku rules.
	•	Testing Suite: Includes test cases to verify functionality, such as sequence detection and move evaluation.

## How to Run
	1.	Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
	2.	Run the main script: python gomoku.py
 	3.	Follow the prompts to play against the AI or analyze board states.

## Technologies Used
	•	Python
	•	Interactive Console-Based Gameplay

## Future Enhancements
	•	Expand board size and rules for flexibility.
	•	Incorporate a GUI for enhanced user experience.
